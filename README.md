# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Welcome to the Twitter Sentiment Analysis project! This repository contains code and resources for classifying sentiment in Twitter data into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The classification is achieved using different deep learning models, including a simple Dense layer, CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), specifically Bidirectional LSTM.

### Project Description
The goal of this project is to classify Twitter sentiments into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. We use a combination of traditional machine learning approaches and deep learning models, specifically:

Dense layer: A simple neural network with one or more dense layers.
CNN: A Convolutional Neural Network for identifying patterns and features in the text data.
LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory network, particularly using Bidirectional LSTM for capturing dependencies and context in the text data.

### Data
The project uses a Twitter sentiment dataset that includes tweets along with their respective sentiment labels. The dataset needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information before model training.

### Models
Dense layer: A simple neural network model with one or more dense layers for sentiment classification.
CNN: A Convolutional Neural Network model designed to capture patterns and features in the text data.
LSTM: A Bidirectional LSTM model to capture context and dependencies in the tweets.
### Usage
Data Preprocessing: Start by preprocessing the data using the scripts provided in the preprocessing directory.
Model Training: Train the desired model using scripts provided in the models directory.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance using the provided evaluation scripts.
Visualization: Visualize the results using scripts in the visualization directory.

### Results and Visualizations
The results and visualizations of the project can be found in the results directory. The directory includes performance metrics, visualizations, and other analysis related to the models.
